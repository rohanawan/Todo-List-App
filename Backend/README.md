## Quick Start

To run a project, simply run:

To install dependencies

```bash
npm install 
```

To run project

```bash
npm run dev 
```


## Commands

Running locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Running in production:

```bash
yarn start
```

Testing:

```bash
# run all tests
yarn test

# run all tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# run test coverage
yarn coverage
```

Docker:

```bash
# run docker container in development mode
yarn docker:dev

# run docker container in production mode
yarn docker:prod

# run all tests in a docker container
yarn docker:test
```

## Environment Variables

The environment variables can be found and modified in the `.env` file. They come with these default values:

```bash
# Port number
PORT=3000

# URL of the Mongo DB
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/node-boilerplate

# JWT
# JWT secret key
JWT_SECRET=thisisasamplesecret
# Number of minutes after which an access token expires
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRATION_MINUTES=30
# Number of days after which a refresh token expires
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS=30

# SMTP configuration options for the email service
# For testing, you can use a fake SMTP service like Ethereal: https://ethereal.email/create
SMTP_HOST=email-server
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=email-server-username
SMTP_PASSWORD=email-server-password
EMAIL_FROM=support@yourapp.com
```

## Authentication

To require authentication for certain routes, you can use the `auth` middleware.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const auth = require('../../middlewares/auth');
const userController = require('../../controllers/user.controller');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/users', auth(), userController.createUser);
```

These routes require a valid JWT access token in the Authorization request header using the Bearer schema. If the
request does not contain a valid access token, an Unauthorized (401) error is thrown.

**Generating Access Tokens**:

An access token can be generated by making a successful call to the register (`POST /v1/auth/register`) or
login (`POST /v1/auth/login`) endpoints. The response of these endpoints also contains refresh tokens (explained below).

An access token is valid for 30 minutes. You can modify this expiration time by changing
the `JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRATION_MINUTES` environment variable in the .env file.

**Refreshing Access Tokens**:

After the access token expires, a new access token can be generated, by making a call to the refresh token
endpoint (`POST /v1/auth/refresh-tokens`) and sending along a valid refresh token in the request body. This call returns
a new access token and a new refresh token.

A refresh token is valid for 30 days. You can modify this expiration time by changing the `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS`
environment variable in the .env file.

## Authorization

The `auth` middleware can also be used to require certain rights/permissions to access a route.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const auth = require('../../middlewares/auth');
const userController = require('../../controllers/user.controller');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/users', auth('manageUsers'), userController.createUser);
```

In the example above, an authenticated user can access this route only if that user has the `manageUsers` permission.

The permissions are role-based. You can view the permissions/rights of each role in the `src/config/roles.js` file.

If the user making the request does not have the required permissions to access this route, a Forbidden (403) error is
thrown.


Happy Hacking!
